abstract = {Motifs in complex biological, technological, and social networks, or in other types of networks are connected to patterns that occur at significantly higher frequency compared to similar random networks. Finding motifs helps scientists to know more about networks' structure and function, and this goal cannot be achieved without efficient algorithms. Existing methods for counting network motifs are extremely costly in CPU time and memory consumption. In addition, they restrict to the larger motifs. In this paper, a new algorithm called FraMo is presented based on ‘fractal theory'. This method consists of three phases: at first, a complex network is converted to a multifractal network. Then, using maximum likelihood estimation, distribution parameters is estimated for the multifractal network, and at last the approximate number of network motifs is calculated. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our algorithm can efficiently approximate the number of motifs in any size in undirected networks and compare its performance favorably with similar existing algorithms in terms of CPU time and memory usage.},

abstract = {We test for the presence of multifractality in the daily returns of the three most important stock market indices from Central and Eastern Europe, Czech PX, Hungarian BUX and Polish WIG using the Empirical Mode Decomposition based Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis. We found that the global Hurst coefficient varies with the q coefficient and that there is multifractality evidenced through the multifractal spectrum. The exercise is replicated for the sample around the high volatility period corresponding to the last global financial crisis. Although no direct link has been found between the crisis and the multifractal spectrum, the crisis was found to influence the overall shape as quantified through the norm of the multifractal spectrum.

@article{Liu2015,
abstract = {Complex networks have attracted much attention in diverse areas of science and technology. Multifractal analysis (MFA) is a useful way to systematically describe the spatial heterogeneity of both theoretical and experimental fractal patterns. In this paper, we employ the sandbox (SB) algorithm proposed by T$\backslash$'{\{}e{\}}l et al. (Physica A, 159 (1989) 155-166), for MFA of complex networks. First we compare the SB algorithm with two existing algorithms of MFA for complex networks: the compact-box-burning (CBB) algorithm proposed by Furuya and Yakubo (Phys. Rev. E, 84 (2011) 036118), and the improved box-counting (BC) algorithm proposed by Li et al. (J. Stat. Mech.: Theor. Exp., 2014 (2014) P02020) by calculating the mass exponents tau(q) of some deterministic model networks. We make a detailed comparison between the numerical and theoretical results of these model networks. The comparison results show that the SB algorithm is the most effective and feasible algorithm to calculate the mass exponents tau(q) and to explore the multifractal behavior of complex networks. Then we apply the SB algorithm to study the multifractal property of some classic model networks, such as scale-free networks, small-world networks, and random networks. Our results show that multifractality exists in scale-free networks, that of small-world networks is not obvious, and it almost does not exist in random networks.},

abstract="Spatially structured populations have been used in evolutionary computation for many years. Somewhat surprisingly, in the multiobjective optimization domain, very few spatial models have been proposed. In this paper, we introduce a new multiobjective evolutionary algorithm on complex networks. Here, the individuals in the evolving population are mapped onto the nodes of alternative complex networks -- regular, small-world, scale-free and random. A selection regime based on a non-dominance rating and a crowding mechanism guides the evolutionary trajectory. Our model can be seen as an extension of the standard cellular evolutionary algorithm. However, the dynamical behaviour of the evolving population is constrained by the particular network architecture. An important contribution of this paper is the detailed analysis of the impact that the structural properties of the network -- node degree distribution, characteristic path length and clustering coefficient -- have on the behaviour of the evolutionary algorithm using benchmark bi-objective problems.",

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that genomes can be studied via a multifractal formalism. Recently, we used a multifractal approach to study the genetic information content of the Caenorhabditis elegans genome. Here we investigate the possibility that the human genome shows a similar behavior to that observed in the nematode.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We report here multifractality in the human genome sequence. This behavior correlates strongly on the presence of Alu elements and to a lesser extent on CpG islands and (G+C) content. In contrast, no or low relationship was found for LINE, MIR, MER, LTRs elements and DNA regions poor in genetic information. Gene function, cluster of orthologous genes, metabolic pathways, and exons tended to increase their frequencies with ranges of multifractality and large gene families were located in genomic regions with varied multifractality. Additionally, a multifractal map and classification for human chromosomes are proposed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings, we propose a descriptive non-linear model for the structure of the human genome, with some biological implications. This model reveals 1) a multifractal regionalization where many regions coexist that are far from equilibrium and 2) this non-linear organization has significant molecular and medical genetic implications for understanding the role of Alu elements in genome stability and structure of the human genome. Given the role of Alu sequences in gene regulation, genetic diseases, human genetic diversity, adaptation and phylogenetic analyses, these quantifications are especially useful.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. Complex networks have gained much attention from different areas of knowledge in recent years. Particularly, the structures and dynamics of such systems have attracted considerable interest. Complex networks may have characteristics of multifractality. In this study, we analyze fractal and multifractal properties of a novel network: the large scale economic network of payments of Estonia, where companies are represented by nodes and the payments done between companies are represented by links. We present a fractal scaling analysis and examine the multifractal behavior of this network by using a sandbox algorithm. Our results indicate the existence of multifractality in this network and consequently, the existence of multifractality in the Estonian economy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that analyzes multifractality of a complex network of payments.},

abstract = {Complex networks have recently attracted much attention in diverse areas of science and technology. Many networks such as the WWW and biological networks are known to display spatial heterogeneity which can be characterized by their fractal dimensions. Multifractal analysis is a useful way to systematically describe the spatial heterogeneity of both theoretical and experimental fractal patterns. In this paper, we propose a new box covering algorithm for multifractal analysis of complex networks. This algorithm is used to calculate the generalized fractal dimensions {\$}D{\_}{\{}q{\}}{\$} of some theoretical networks, namely scale-free networks, small world networks and random networks, and one kind of real networks, namely protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of different species. Our numerical results indicate the existence of multifractality in scale-free networks and PPI networks, while the multifractal behavior is not clear-cut for small world networks and random networks. The possible variation of {\$}D{\_}{\{}q{\}}{\$} due to changes in the parameters of the theoretical network models is also discussed.},

  abstract={As Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi)-enabled handheld devices have been widely used, the mobile social networks (MSNs) has been attracting extensive attention. Fractal approaches have also been widely applied to characterierize natural networks as useful tools to depict their spatial distribution and scaling properties. Moreover, when the complexity of the spatial distribution of MSNs cannot be properly charaterized by single fractal dimension, multifractal analysis is required. For further research, we introduced a multifractal analysis method based on box-covering algorithm to describe the structure of MSNs. Using this method, we find that the networks are multifractal at different time interval. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient for analyzing the multifractal characteristic of MSNs, which provides a distribution of singularities adequately describing both the heterogeneity of fractal patterns and the statistics of measurements across spatial scales in MSNs.}
